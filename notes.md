# Conquering Responsive Design Notes

## Day 01 | Using percentages & avoiding heights

- use percentages for widths
- attempt not to define heights
- `em` is a responsive unit that is relative to the font size of the parent element
  - compounds for every parent element
- `rem` is a responsive unit that is relative to the font size of the root element
  - does not compound

### em vs rem

When used for margin and padding, `em` is relative to that element's font-size, while `rem` is still relative to the root element.
